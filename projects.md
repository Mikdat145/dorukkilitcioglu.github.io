### [A Monte Carlo Algorithm for Cold Start Recommendation](https://github.com/dorukkilitcioglu/boun_cmpe548_project)
Description:  
· Implemented a research paper on collaborative filtering based Monte Carlo Algorithm for cold-start recommendation  
· Decreased MAE (Mean Absolute Error) by 1.8% by using better transition priors and verified results using MovieLens database  
Tags: Recommender Systems, Monte Carlo Methods, Machine Learning, Python

### [Content-based similar movie recommendation engine](https://github.com/dorukkilitcioglu/cbf-movie-similarity)
Description:  
· Implemented a content-based filtering approach to movie recommendation, using movie plots, paper by Fleischman et al.  
· Improved the user-rated similarities by 3.5% (verified using A/B testing) using Named Entity Recognition to simplify names and converting plots into topic vectors using Latent Dirichlet Allocation

### [doc-annotate: A minimalistic tool for annotating documents](https://github.com/dorukkilitcioglu/doc-annotate)
Description:  
· Basic web tool for annotating the sentiment of articles  
· Allows for choosing between 3 levels of sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) and 3 levels of relevance (relevant, irrelevant, neutral)  
· Built using Flask & MongoDB
