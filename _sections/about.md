I'm a Computer Science Masters student at NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (class of 2019), with a passion for Machine Learning and Data Science. Before that, I was studying BS. in Computer Engineering and doing an Economics minor at Bogazici University in Turkey, with one semester spent at the University of Queensland in Australia as an exchange student.

My passion lies with making sense of people through data. It generally manifests itself through my interest in Recommender Systems, but I welcome all opportunities for analyzing the data that people produce.

In addition to being a student, I work part time at NYU IT as a Software Developer. In my free time, I like listening to [different kinds of music](https://open.spotify.com/user/dklt), [reading fantasy novels (not counting my obsession with Haruki Murakami)](https://www.goodreads.com/Xyllan
), and playing games.
